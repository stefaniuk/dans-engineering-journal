# 🧭 Dan's Engineering Journal

Welcome to the repository for [stefaniuk.co.uk](stefaniuk.co.uk) - my professional technology blog, serving as both a public knowledge base and a live record of my ongoing journey through software engineering, cloud architecture, and technical leadership. This site is where I openly share discoveries, deep technical dives, hands-on tutorials, and candid reflections on both success and setbacks.

## 🎯 Purpose & Philosophy

This blog is designed not just as a personal archive, but as a practical resource for fellow engineers, architects, and technology enthusiasts. My intention is to foster a culture of learning, knowledge sharing, and open dialogue across the professional community.

My intention is that you will find here the following:

- 🛠️ Real-world solutions, articles addressing concrete technical challenges, grounded in practical experience.
- 🧠 Deep technical exploration, content that examines architectural decisions, design trade-offs, and underlying principles—not just the “how”, but also the “why”.
- 🗣️ Clear, accessible communication, complex concepts are broken down into simple language, making advanced topics approachable.
- 🌱 Professional growth, honest documentation of my learning process, including mistakes and lessons learned, so that others can benefit from my experience.
- 🤝 Open collaboration, a space for feedback, alternative perspectives, and professional networking.

Each article and update represents my commitment to:

- 🔬 Thorough research and exploration
- ✍️ Clear, concise documentation
- 🪞 Transparency about both successes and challenges
- 📈 Continuous learning and improvement

Whether you are an experienced technologist or early in your career, you’ll find authentic insights and actionable knowledge to support your own professional development.

## 🧑‍💻 Local Development & Contribution

You are encouraged to reuse, adapt, or contribute to this blog’s content and technical setup. All scripts and configuration are provided for easy local development and automation.

### 📦 Prerequisites

- 💎 Ruby (2.7.0 or newer)
- 📦 RubyGems (comes with Ruby)
- 🛠️ make (standard on macOS/Linux)

### 🍏 Installing Jekyll on macOS

1. Install Bundler and Jekyll

    ```bash
    gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
    ```

2. Install project dependencies

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

### 🖥️ Running the site locally

1. Start the Jekyll server:

    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`

### 🏗️ Building Static Files

1. To generate the static files for production:

    ```bash
    JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
    ```

   This will create the static site in the `_site` directory.

2. For development builds with draft posts:

    ```bash
    JEKYLL_ENV=development bundle exec jekyll build --drafts
    ```

### 🛠️ Using Make Commands

The project includes several helpful make commands:

- `make serve-drafts` - Start local server with draft posts (development)
- `make serve-live` - Start local server without drafts (production)
- `make clean` - Remove generated files and caches
- `make update` - Clean and rebuild the site
- `make publish` - Build and publish to GitHub Pages

### 🔄 Indicating Post Updates

If you revise a published post and want to show readers (and search engines) that it has been updated without changing the original publication date, add BOTH a `last_modified_at` field and set `display_last_modified: true` in the post front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Some Post"
date: 2024-05-12 08:00:00 Europe/London
last_modified_at: 2025-09-19 09:00:00 Europe/London
display_last_modified: true
---
```

Behaviour:

- The "Last updated" section renders only if `display_last_modified: true` AND `last_modified_at` is later than the original `date`.
- Omitting either the flag or the timestamp means only the original published date is shown.
- Uses the `jekyll-last-modified-at` plugin; outputs semantic `<time>` elements with `itemprop="datePublished"` and `itemprop="dateModified"` for improved SEO / structured data.

Best practice:

- Update the field only for substantive changes (new sections, significant clarifications, updated code / versions) – ignore minor typo fixes.
- Consider keeping a short "Changelog" or "Revision notes" section for heavily revised technical articles.
