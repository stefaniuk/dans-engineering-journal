I decided to blog. This is long overdue. I should have started this years ago. This begs the question why didn't I? I code at work I code at home. Time is very precious for me... and yes, there are more important things in live than a hobby. But I'm going to try anyway!

There is an objective, self-improvement. Continuous learning is part of being a good programmer. The world around us changes quickly. Coping with change is no longer sufficient. We need to embrace it.

I also believe that keeping notes of what I do will help me gain better understanding of the problems I solve. Maintaining good reading habits and writing a lot of code is one thing. But sharing the knowledge and being able to explain all of that to others requires deep insight - here is my challenge!
